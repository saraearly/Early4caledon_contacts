Peter.,Jeffrey,Peter.Jeffrey@nissancanada.com,(416) 576-9140,,,,,,Valleywood,,,,"My name is Peter Jeffrey and am currently a resident of Caledon, living in the Valleywood community with my family for the past 17 years. My wife and I made the decision to move to Caledon from Brampton so many years ago to take advantage of the amazing community and family oriented lifestyle that Caledon had to offer. Our family has grown since we initially moved back in November of 2004 and we now have 3 children (2 boys and a girl) who range in age from 10 to 18. For them, Valleywood and Caledon is all they have ever really known.

For many years, Valleywood was a very pleasant, quiet, friendly and quite honestly, ideal place to live. Summer soccer league games at Lina Marino Park were so very important to our family, as they were for so many others in the neighbourhood. Most people knew each other, knew each otherâ€™s children and were friendly to one another. Locking the door of your house wasnâ€™t necessary because you knew most of the neighbourhood and everybody trusted one another.

I am writing you today to express my concern, as I see Valleywood transitioning into something I can no longer stand by and watch without voicing my concern. There is a reason why houses are going up for sale at a record pace in the neighbourhood and it is not simply because people are taking advantage of the hot housing market. People are seeing what I am seeing happen to this once beautiful area of Caledon and are moving out because the community is no longer what it wasâ€¦â€¦it truly is â€œthe forgotten community of Caledonâ€. Police presence here is non-existent. Honestly, I am not sure the OPP know that Valleywood and its residents exist at allâ€¦..perhaps they think it is part of Brampton and thus, would fall under Peel Regional Police jurisdiction? Not sureâ€¦

The reason I say this is because today, Valleywood residentsâ€™ homes and cars are being broken into far more often than ever before. When we moved here back in 2004, these types of incidents were extremely rareâ€¦.today they are a common occurrence. Recently, more and more people have been making their way into our community from Brampton and other parts of Caledon to take advantage of the Lina Marino Park and its many playing fields. With this, it is also bringing people who donâ€™t have the same care or respect for the neighbourhood as the residents. The result is that many of these people (not all but many) are using our Valleywood recreational facilities as their personal garbage cans and litter is strewn throughout the park from the parking lot to the soccer fields. Even the outdated play area with swings and slides, where little children under 5 years old play is littered with garbage. As disgusting as it is to say, it is not uncommon to find used condoms in the parking lot of the park when I am walking our dog in the morningâ€¦.it is absolutely disgusting.

Mr. Thompson, I am writing you today to voice my concerns over what I am seeing happening here in Valleywood and why I am considering, like so many others, to move my family out of Caledon altogether. Also, because I care!! I care about Caledon and I care about the people who live here and call it home.

What I am asking from you is to come and see for yourself how Valleywood has changed and experience what is happening here first hand. I would be more than happy to meet you at the park on a Saturday or Sunday morning and you can help me pick up the garbage from the night before. For example, yesterday morning I picked up over 60 water, juice and energy drink plastic bottles in the park without getting everything. Please see attached picture.

Donâ€™t get me wrong Mr. Thompson, there are many things about this neighbourhood that are still great but I am afraid that if things continue to change as they have recently, the Jeffrey family will also be placing a â€œFor Saleâ€ sign on the lawn very soon as well and bidding farewell to Caledon for goodâ€¦â€¦

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Regards,

Hi

I have lived at 18881 Airport Rd since Feb 1977.
I recently saw the video and am concerned with trucks and equipment parked at 18136 Airport Rd just south of Charleston Sideroad on the west side.
To make matters worse ugly wooden fencing partitions are being installed and looking like they could fall over. I drive by daily.
Please investigate as these appear to be parked illegally without parking lot be designated such as gravel area.
Thanks and please advise

I Hope this email finds you in good health and cheer. I am in receipt of a notice from you on behalf of the town to enter my property at 6902 Mayfield Road, Caledon. I understand that you want to remove fill from my property. I understand the town's concerns and wish to work with you to resolve the situation. I am open to directions and suggestions from the town but would need some time to execute them. Winter may not be the best time to begin & execute a job of this nature. So, I suggest and request to be allowed until spring to begin the removal.
The reason I did not begin already is because the matter is subjudice in court.
I hope you would understand and accommodate my request as I feel you have the town's best interest in mind and your time and the town's resources could be put to better use if I am allowed the time to do this myself.

Warmest Regards

I have a question regarding the completely unused tennis courts in Inglewood, behind the community centre.  I want to use the courts and was directed by Caledon staff to contact the Inglewood Racquet Club as they stated these courts are private.  Why are courts on public land only accessible to a private club?

This would seem a strange arrangement but may answer why I have never seen anyone using this public facility over the last 8 years.  Why would Caledon residents have to join a private club when this resource sits completely unused but presumably built and maintained by Caledon?

I did reach out to the club as I do want to use the courts but the email bounce back.  Is the Racquet Club a going concern at this point?

In my 19 years living in the area, I don't remember ever seeing any litter. The residents take responsibility for protecting the environment as well as their 2-3 acre lots. My experience from visiting friends who live in townhouses is completely different. There always seems to be garbage (fast food bags, Tim Hortons cups, wrappers, etc) in all the ditches and beside every stop sign. It is just a symptom of what happens when you cluster a lot of people together. They don't take personal ownership of the land around them. People crammed together is never a good thing for the environment. (I won't even get into the disastrous environmental issues that can arise when trying to have 18+ homes on 1 septic tank)

Because we are in the Oak Ridges Moraine I would have hoped that any proposed changes would involve limiting and/or stopping any new development whatsoever, not bringing in townhouse clusters which traditionally have been detrimental to the environment.

I email again today, as a road rage incident just occurred outside my front door, as 2 cars sped well over the speed limit trying to pass each other down dougall.
This street is so incredibly unsafe and with the park right here and multiple families crossing the road or getting out of their cars someone is going to get seriously injured.

please let me know who I should speak to about this.

Hi Annette and Team,

I live on Dougall Avenue in southfields, west of Kennedy across from the little skating rink/park area. The speed limit on this road is 40km, but because itâ€™s a straight away, drivers consistently speed, driving upwards of 100km on this street. I have dealt with this for the last 4 years, my dog was even hit a couple of years ago. There are too many kids on this street who run back and forth to this park and someone is going to get killed. I constantly have to ask drivers to slow down and am always being yelled at and told to F off. We need speed bumps on this road as soon as possible for the safety of the kids and the community. Who do I speak to to ensure this can get done soon?

I appreciate you pointing me in the right direction.

Thank you
Nikki Bettinelli

I would like to extend my appreciation for the work that you have initiated on the barrier at 32 Treeview Cres. Itâ€™s nice to know that progress is being made after twenty  years of our efforts through other channels.

However, I would like to know if you can help with the other issues or who we need to get in touch with that could can help. The issues are:

1.      Extending the wall east of 25 Treeview Cres at least 35 metres to protect the residents from the noise and ground level view of the six lanes of HWY 410
2.      Installing a â€œNo engine brakesâ€ sign on the Valleywood ramp.

I would like to know is there a plan for an off leash dog park in the community? I have seen so many dog owners struggle to help their dog enjoy to the fullest and have to travel a distance to get to an off each dog park. Given the space we have in caledon and the neighboring areas of southfield village especially the under developed side is there a plan to set up an off leash dog park ?

If there is not plan on place, please suggest how I can propose one given the list of dog owners I can put together for you.

We live at 6415 King Street, Caledon, L7C0V2, we have lived here for 25 years and have never had anything like this happen but on this morning November 16th 2022 we woke up to this.  This is my daughter's car, it was parked at least 8 ft into our driveway.  The Region of Peel's ""contracted"" snow plow had to be going 80-100km to send that much snow and rocks that far over the front of her car. If someone was shovelling snow they would have been seriously hurt or killed.
I was lucky enough that Automotive Maintenance in Caledon East could take me right away to fix the window. It cost me $395.50 and $15.81 to do an exterior wash 2 days later due to the adhesive on the window to cure. We will find pieces of glass into 2024.
I reported all of this immediately to the Loss Mgmt email on Region of Peels website
